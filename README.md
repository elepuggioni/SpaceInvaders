# SpaceInvaders

This is a university group project created by @steena5 and @elepuggioni for our Sistemi Operativi 1 (Operating Systems 1) course.

This program is a simplified reproduction of the popular Space Invaders game.

This CLI game is made in C and uses multi-threading. The threads communicate through a shared buffer memory, with conflicts and race conditions being avoided through the use of semaphores.
